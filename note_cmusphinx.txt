1/ ERROR: "backward.c", line 430: Failed to align audio to transcript: final state of the search is not reached.
Sometimes audio in your database doesn't match the transcription properly
In that case you need to enable forced alignment stage in training. To do that edit sphinx_train.cfg line
	$CFG_FORCEDALIGN = 'yes';

2/use context-dependent training
	$CFG_CD_TRAIN

3/ Can't open */*-1-1.match word_align.pl failed with error code 65280

This error occurs because the decoder did not run properly after training. First check if the correct executable (psdecode_batch if the decoding script being used is psdecode.pl as set by $DEC_CFG_SCRIPT variable in sphinx_train.cfg) is present in PATH. On Linux run

	which pocketsphinx_batch
and see if it is located. If it is not, you need to set the PATH variable properly. Similarly on Windows, run

	where pocketsphinx_batch*
If the path to decoding executable is set properly, read the log files at logdir/decode/ to find out other reasons behind the error.
